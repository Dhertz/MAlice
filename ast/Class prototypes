Class prototypes:

This is a list of class constructors I have need for that don't exist yet:

HeaderParamAST(SymbolTable*, pANTLR3_BASE_TREE);
-- the tree's children are the header params, it's flat tree

ProcDecAST(SymbolTable*, string, HeaderParamAST);
-- the string is the function name

FuncDecAST(SymbolTable*, string, HeaderParamAST, string)
-- first string is name, second string is type

VariableDecAST(SymbolTable*, string, string, ExprAST*)
-- like the current one but with an ExprAST to support inline assignments
-- keep the old one too

ExprAST(SymbolTable*, pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)
-- Need to be pased the tree to type check the expression all the way down the tree

ArrayDecAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*, string)
-- ExprAST is the size of the array, string is the type

CallParamsAST(SymbolTable*, pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)
-- unlike HPs this tree won't be flat; it's a list of expressions

FuncAST(SymbolTable*, string, CallParamsAST*)
-- basically identical to CallAST in notes

ArrayAssignAST(SymbolTable*, string, ExprAST*, ExprAST*)
-- first ExprAST is element number, second is new value

IncAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)

DecAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)

PrintAST(SymbolTable*, string, ExprAST*)
-- this constructor is for printing an array member

PrintAST(SymbolTable*, string, CallParamsAST*)
-- this is for printing a function call

PrintAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)
-- this is for printing any old expression - maybe we don't need the first one?

ReturnAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)

StdinAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)

WhileAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)
-- Expr is loop condition (I don't think you need anything else..?)

ChoiceAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)
-- Same as while I think

IfAST(SymbolTable*, ExprAST*)
