Class prototypes:

This is a list of class constructors I have need for that don't exist yet:

HeaderParamAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, pANTLR3_BASE_TREE);
-- the tree's children are the header params, it's flat tree

ProcDecAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, string, HeaderParamAST);
-- the string is the function name

FuncDecAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, string, HeaderParamAST, string)
-- first string is name, second string is type

VariableDecAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, string, string, ExprAST*)
-- like the current one but with an ExprAST to support inline assignments
-- keep the old one too

ExprAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)
-- Need to be pased the tree to type check the expression all the way down the tree

ArrayDecAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*, string)
-- ExprAST is the size of the array, string is the type

CallParamsAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)
-- unlike HPs this tree won't be flat; it's a list of expressions

FuncAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, string, CallParamsAST*)
-- basically identical to CallAST in notes

ArrayAssignAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, string, ExprAST*, ExprAST*)
-- first ExprAST is element number, second is new value

IncAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)

DecAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)

PrintAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, string, ExprAST*)
-- this constructor is for printing an array member

PrintAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, string, CallParamsAST*)
-- this is for printing a function call

PrintAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)
-- this is for printing any old expression - maybe we don't need the first one?

ReturnAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)

StdinAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)

WhileAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)
-- Expr is loop condition (I don't think you need anything else..?)

ChoiceAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)
-- Same as while I think

IfAST(boost::shared_ptr<SymbolTable>, ExprAST*)
