TODO list:
Part 2:
	- Write tool for semantic analysis
	- Replace string getID() methods with enum return type, and better method name
	- Make sure strings can't be in the base case of recursive ExprAST
	- Check EXACTLY ONE hatta exists, has no arguments, and is void
	- Check all things that require a "Number" and see if they can actually take a "Letter" too
	  (Inc/Dec spring to mind)
