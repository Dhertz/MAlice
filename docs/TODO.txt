TODO list:
Part 2:
	- Better method names (getTypeName on Expr should be getType, for eg)
	- Check all things that require a "Number" and see if they can actually take a "Letter" too (Inc/Dec spring to mind)
	- Lose the constructor arguments on Number
	- Better var names when adding to top ST
	- General style standardisation
	- Cheeky global Ctrl+F to check all Boost constructions are safe
	- Don't like the way PrintAST handles the multiple cases
	- Watch out for circular references, and general memory leak tests
	- Rename isDeclarable?
