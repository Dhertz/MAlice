TODO list:
Part 2:
	- Watch out for circular references, and general memory leak tests
	- Global error count?
	- How does CallParams work when errored cases arent added to the vector?
	- Make type strings lower case to match top level ST
	- Check no tabs
	- Make sure arrays can't be in the base of an expression due to VAR tok
	- Remove duplication in ExprAST recursive method
	- Rename FuncAST to FuncProcCallAST (at least I think that's what it is...)
	- Check that return in a proc breaks
	- Check parse error case on ReturnAST
	- Check no lines of just spaces/tabs (Ctrl+F for space NL)
	- Check the not assignable check in VarAssign with respect to array elements (might be better to use isAssignable?Â Which needs renaming to isAssignable)
