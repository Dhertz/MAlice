TODO list:
Part 2:
	- Better method names (getTypeName on Expr should be getType, for eg)
	- General style standardisation
	- Watch out for circular references, and general memory leak tests
	- Rename isDeclarable?
	- Rename Stdin? And standardise the VariableAssign/VarDec ones
	- Global error count?
	- Make all error messages better, and put it in a Utils method
	- How does CallParams work when errored cases arent added to the vector?
	- Make type strings lower case to match top level ST
	- Check no tabs
	- Make sure arrays can't be in the base of an expression due to VAR tok
